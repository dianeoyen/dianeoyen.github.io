Research Interests
======
I am a machine learning researcher in the [Information Sciences](http://www.lanl.gov/org/ddste/aldsc/computer-computational-statistical-sciences/information-sciences/) group at the [Los Alamos National Laboratory](http://www.lanl.gov). I develop machine learning methods to help scientists analyze complex data. My research areas include trustworthy and reliable AI, probabilistic graphical models, unsupervised machine learning, interactive machine learning, transfer learning and lifelong machine learning. Applications include image analysis and remote sensing.

* Project Leader / Principal Investigator:
  * Uncertainty quantification for robust machine learning (UQ4ML)
  * Visual data analytics tools (VDAT)
  * Image analysis using graphs (GoFigure)
* Applications of machine learning projects include learning image analysis, Che\
mCam spectroscopy data analysis, and other scientific data analysis problems.
